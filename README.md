# Description
Farming has been the major feeder of most developing countries in Africa, African countries majorly rely on farm products for an economic sustainability. Kenya being my area of study, i found out that a whole 65% of people who live in rural areas do not seek for skilled office employment, but depend entirely on harvested crops in order for them to make a living. Howeve, they are normally faced with the challenge of getting a very efficient and elaborate way to sell their farm produce and maximize on their value. Many end up getting little pay for their hardwork due to the ever extending middle men in the value chain. They are also faced with the challenge of being able to predict the ever changing flavour of customers on their products. This is the most fundermental reason why i created Agrisasa application.


Whats my goal here? 

"Successful entreneural economy is a sort of behavior that includes initiative taking, organizing and re-organizing  of social and economic mecahnisms"-Sapero,1975 .  True work is work that can be accounted for and subjected to evaluation.

My goal here is to create a condusive environment full of transparency, full of trust, full of confidence and environment where a company, and individual, organization or a private institudion is able to actively monitor the progress of every employee at realtime, analysing information in a centralized way that gives more insights on better ways of improving the organization.

To maintain the best of my goal , i have made this app to have several managers and several users.

The user creates an account and selects the company he/she is working for. The This user will be awaiting to be assigned a task by the manager, one the task is assigned, this user has to accept the task. Once the task is accepted, the tracking progress begins.  On completion, the worker has to declare the task to be complete, awaiting verification from the manager and the owners of the premises.

This gives more insights on the managers side, since the manager will be able to watch all the movements, angles, timings and behavious of this employee basing on a machine learning model. This gives a big insight on the workers ethics as it makes the worker more productive and honest to the organization. Ths manager then recieves a completion request from the worker, he then validates the work and declare the work correct, if correctly done and resources used correctly.
